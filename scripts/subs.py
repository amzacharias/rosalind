"""
Given two strings s and t, t is a substring of s if t is contained as a
contiguous collection of symbols in s (as a result, t must be no longer than s).

The position of a symbol in a string is the total number of symbols found
 to its left, including itself (e.g., the positions of all occurrences of
  'U' in "AUGCUUCAGAAAGGUCUUACG" are 2, 5, 6, 15, 17, and 18). The symbol at
   position i of s is denoted by s[i].

A substring of s can be represented as s[j:k], where j and k represent
 the starting and ending positions of the substring in s; for example,
  if s = "AUGCUUCAGAAAGGUCUUACG", then s[2:5] = "UGCU".

The location of a substring s[j:k] is its beginning position j;
note that t will have multiple locations in s if it occurs more than
 once as a substring of s (see the Sample below).
