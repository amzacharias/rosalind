In a dictionary there are keys:values.
    keys can be strings, numbers, floats, or other immutable types
    values can be any type

accessing values from a dictionary:
    phones = {'Zoe':'232-43-58', 'Alice':165-88-56}
    print(phones['Zoe'])

adding new values or assigning a new value to an existing key:
    phones['Zoe'] = '658-99-55'
    phones['Bill'] = '342-18-25' # Bill appears at the end of the dictionary
    print(phones)

Ordering of dictionaries:
    case senstive ~ uppercase is before lowercase

Create an empty dictionary:
    d = {}
    # Can use to add values dynamically (ex. reading a file)

Check whether a key is in the dictionary:
    if 'Peter' in phones:
        print "We know Peter's phone"
    else:
        print "We don't know Peter's phone"

# Delete a key:value pair
    phones = {'Zoe':'232-43-58', 'Alice':'165-88-56'}
    del(phones['Zoe'])
    print(phones)
